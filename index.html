				<h1>Special Connections </h1>
				<h4>2014</h4>
				<p>Special Connections is a unique social networking site in that it also offers educational opportunities. To our knowledge, Special Connections is one of the first social networking sites designed for people with special needs. Instead of using a simple website, Special Connections uses typical social media forms of communication (e.g. messaging, video chatting) to accomplish our learning goal of teaching a person with special needs social skills.</p>

					<h1>Prime III One Ballot project</h1>
					<h4>2014</h4>
					<p>Prime III is the world's single most accessible electronic voting system. It offers a secure, multimodal electronic voting system that delivers the necessary system security, integrity and user satisfaction safeguards in a user friendly interface that accommodates all people regardless of ability. Prime III implements a Universal Design. By Universal Design, we mean " an approach to the design of all products and environments to be as usable as possible by as many people as possible regardless of age, ability or situation. In this project we sought to redesign Prime III and also make it become more portable by reducing its code base into a single html file.</p>

					<h1>Week One</h1>
					<h5>05/29/14</h5>
					<p>During Week One me and my fellow DREU members began deciding on which projects that we will 
					be of interest of working on during the summer. I had chosen the Special Connections social networking site and Prime III One Ballot site projects.  Later towards the end of that week
					I met up with my project mentor Amber Solemon who assigned me a part of their research paper 
					they were submitting for publishing titled "Gendered Voices: Provocateur in an On-Line Virtual Conference Course for In-Service Teachers" </p>

				<div class='entry'> 
					<h1>Week Two</h1>
					<h5>06/1/14</h5>
					<p>Second week I completed my related works section for the research paper for my group in the Special Connections project. Following that I discovered that I will be working on the avatar, chat room, and video chat room for the project. I later met with Nicholas Mcelveeen over the design mockups for the Single HTML ballot for prime III.  My task will be to develop his design ideas and also make the user interactivity and experience.</p>

					<h1>Week Three</h1>
					<h5>06/7/14</h5>
					<p>For this week my task was to work on developing the design ideas and make the user interactivity for the Single HTML Ballot for prime III. We later followed up with a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the work I had done. We discussed how the selection should look when selected to inverse the black and white colors with background and font color. Then we spoked about how we would collaborate as a team with the code and what has been decided was to use git as our control system along with Bitbucket to host our private repository. As for the Special Connections project I was assigned to work on the avatar from SitePal.com and make sure to write a script that based on any particular textbox selection the avatar will speak a customized message based on that textbox.  Another criteria was to design the implemntation of the script in the most easily managemable and dynamic way possible. Which I took to use a configuration javascript file that uses an key-value pair object to set textbox's class names to correlate with a string of scripted text for the avatar to say.</p>
				</div>
				<div class='entry'>
					<h1>Week Four</h1>
					<h5>06/13/14</h5>
					<p>First we finished generating a spoken message for the avatar on the basis of which text box the user has selected. The script for that is finished and a test is available by this link <a href='http://hcc.cs.clemson.edu/~najamack/nick-folder/index.html' target = '_blank' style='color:#fff;'>http://hcc.cs.clemson.edu/~najamack/nick-folder/index.html</a> We are looking into video chatting software that would work best for user to user communication and for the parent's chat room but for now, we have focused our efforts on designing the rest of the pages before meeting the system goals. Lastly we have finished designing the "Members Accepted" pages. </p>
