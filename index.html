				<h1>Special Connections </h1>
				<h4>2014</h4>
				<p>Special Connections is a unique social networking site in that it also offers educational opportunities. To our knowledge, Special Connections is one of the first social networking sites designed for people with special needs. Instead of using a simple website, Special Connections uses typical social media forms of communication (e.g. messaging, video chatting) to accomplish our learning goal of teaching a person with special needs social skills.</p>

					<h1>Prime III One Ballot project</h1>
					<h4>2014</h4>
					<p>Prime III is the world's single most accessible electronic voting system. It offers a secure, multimodal electronic voting system that delivers the necessary system security, integrity and user satisfaction safeguards in a user friendly interface that accommodates all people regardless of ability. Prime III implements a Universal Design. By Universal Design, we mean " an approach to the design of all products and environments to be as usable as possible by as many people as possible regardless of age, ability or situation. In this project we sought to redesign Prime III and also make it become more portable by reducing its code base into a single html file.</p>

					<h1>Week One</h1>
					<h5>05/29/14</h5>
					<p>During Week One me and my fellow DREU members began deciding on which projects that we will 
					be of interest of working on during the summer. I had chosen the Special Connections social networking site and Prime III One Ballot site projects.  Later towards the end of that week
					I met up with my project mentor Amber Solemon who assigned me a part of their research paper 
					they were submitting for publishing titled "Gendered Voices: Provocateur in an On-Line Virtual Conference Course for In-Service Teachers" </p>

					<h1>Week Two</h1>
					<h5>06/1/14</h5>
					<p>Second week I completed my related works section for the research paper for my group in the Special Connections project. Following that I discovered that I will be working on the avatar, chat room, and video chat room for the project. I later met with Nicholas Mcelveeen over the design mockups for the Single HTML ballot for prime III.  My task will be to develop his design ideas and also make the user interactivity and experience. </p>
